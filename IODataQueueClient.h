In order to do this, call IODataQueuePeek to get the entry.  Then call IODataQueueDequeue with a NULL data pointer.  That will cause the head to be moved to the next entry, but no memory to be copied.

If a data pointer is provided, it will copy the data into the memory region if there is enough space available as specified in the dataSize parameter.  If no data pointer is provided, it will simply move the head value past the current entry.

 * @param dataSize A pointer to the size of the data parameter.  On return, this contains the size of the actual entry data - even if the original size was not large enough.
 * @result Returns kIOReturnSuccess on success.  Other return values possible are: kIOReturnUnderrun - queue is full, kIOReturnBadArgument - no dataQueue or no dataSize, kIOReturnNoSpace - dataSize is too small for entry.

The returned mach port is allocated with a queue limit of one message.  This allows only one mach message to be queued up at a time.  The IODataQueue code is written with the restriction in mind and will only queue up a message if no messages alread have been sent.
