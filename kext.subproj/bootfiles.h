   Guest mode can be enabled in Users & Groups, but is also implicitly
   enabled by Find My Mac (FMM).  FMM needs guest mode so that people who
   find FDE machines can get them online to receive "good samaritan,"
   "lock," and "wipe" messages.  Guest mode is restrictive and generally

   If a user has trouble remembering their password, they can click on

   will notice that the message was visible when power was forced off and
   the next power-on will go to the Recovery OS with the variable set to
   this value.  The Recovery OS then guides the user towards a password
   change or disabling FDE.  The latter accomodates those with with
